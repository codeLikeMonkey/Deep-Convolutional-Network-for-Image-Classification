# ECE 253 homework 3


part 1

In this part, we implemeted a image classifyer by Pytorch. We classified images by using three different structure CNN net.

network.py
This file contains the neural network structure.

CNN0.py
This file uses the first neural network from network.py 

CNN1.py
This file uses the second neural network from network.py 

CNN2.py
This file uses the second neural network from network.py 

part 2 
In this part, we implemeted transfer learning by using VGG-16.
